# Wine quality prediction

Many people like wine but do not know how to select a wine as the description on wine bottles do not provide much information on the quality of wine. Usually wine bottles mention if it is red wine or white and if it is dry or sweet wine which confuses many. In some countries it is mandatory to mention on wine bottle if a certain chemical is above a certain limit. All this only confuses wine drinkers and provide no information on quality of wine. So, wine makers call a group of wine experts (usually around 10) to taste the wine and give a quality rating and the average rating is used for promotion of wine. The wine experts charge a lot for wine tasting. The goal is to create a wine quality prediction model based on physicochemical properties to help wine makers in making good quality wines, wine experts to avoid bias and wine drinkers with some information on quality of wine.
